# Brads Deals Code Challenge

Thanks for the opportunity to take this code challenge! I had quite a bit of fun going over the JSON data and figuring the best way to display that to the user.

Don't forget to `npm install`!

To run:

`npm run serve`

To Test:

`npm run test:unit`

## Technologies

- VueJS 2
- Vuetify 2.3.x
- Vuex 2.x

## Notes

- The data is stored in a local json file and "loaded" via a fake service with a short timeout to simulate a network request.
- I know vuex was overkill for this, however I really enjoy using and don't get enough opportunities to do so.

### Missed

- I would have liked some more time to get some more tests written for the Vuex store.
- Time to implement handling for an error scenario in case the API call failed
